* # List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

> 1. Conditional Loops

This concept in CS3 is probably my favorite because it is very easy, intuitive (mostly) and also easy to grasp. These are structures that run certain code blocks given a condition is true. These are very helpful as it helps control events and check for things that have happened throughout the code.

Examples: if, else if, else

> 2. Repeating Loops

This is another concept in CS3 that is NOT my favorite because it is very tedious, unintuitive (always) and I guess easy to grasp? These are structures that run multiple times so that the coder does not need to keep writing the same code multiple times. It also allows constant checking of conditions throughout the code and is fundamental to algorithms.

Examples: for, while, do while

> 3. Quotation Marks, Apostrophe, Backticks

These three are practically indistinguishable if you don`t know the differences. The 'apostrophe' I put in don't in the last sentence is actually a backtick, which allows you to add variables in an output seamlessly inside quotation marks. The ones between the word apostrophe are in fact, apostrophes which have similar purposes to the Quotation mark - representing a string.

Example: "", '', ``

> 4. Arrays

Basically, arrays are like big boy variables that can hold multiple values. It contains rows, columns and at some point, idk, more rows for the thirds dimension. These arrays are efficient and great at handling large sets of data without a lot of clutter.

> 5. Arithmetic Operators

These basically allow mathematical and arithmetic operations within the code that are crucial to manipulating data to create simple to complex systems and algorithms. They also allow processes such as arranging values, creating computations and performing crucial operations.

* # List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

* Pre-existing Functions
Sometimes I forget how and when to use these functions properly and effectively.
* Algorithms
I feel like conceptualizing algorithms for certain computational processes should be tackled more.
* Debugging
This concept is really tedious and I feel like I need a lot of help understanding and debugging code.
* Variable Types
Sometimes I get confused on what two variable types that undergo arithmetics output.
* Nested for loops
For loop are confusing enough and I feel like nested ones need to be studied more for me.

* # Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

### Steps on Plan of Action
1. I will advance study by watching tutorials and by trying to code myself.

2. I will enjoy learning and be openminded about concepts in CS.

3. I will see how these things apply to real life and try to do so.

4. I will have fun!

* # In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

* EFFECTIVE
1. Group discussions
2. Hands-on activities

* INEFFECTIVE
1. Fast pacing of lessons
2. Whiteboard discussions
